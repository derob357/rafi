# HEARTBEAT.md — Proactive Check Checklist

## What To Check (every 30 minutes)
- Scan for unread emails — flag anything urgent
- Check calendar for events in the next 2 hours — remind if prep is needed
- Review pending tasks — flag any approaching deadlines
- Check weather — alert if conditions changed significantly since last check

## When To Notify
- Only notify if something genuinely needs attention
- If everything is fine, respond with HEARTBEAT_OK
- Don't repeat the same alert within 24 hours
- During quiet hours, skip notifications entirely

## Memory Maintenance (periodic)
- Review today's daily log for insights worth promoting to MEMORY.md
- Update USER.md if reliable new preferences detected
